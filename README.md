**Participated in SemEval 2022 task 6** 

SemEval is a series of international natural language processing (NLP) research workshops whose mission is to advance the current state of the art in semantic analysis and to help create high-quality annotated datasets in a range of increasingly challenging problems in natural language semantics. Each year's workshop features a collection of shared tasks in which computational semantic analysis systems designed by different teams are presented and compared.
